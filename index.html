    <h2 id="north">North Indian Cuisine</h2>
    <p>North Indian Cuisine is largely influenced by the Mughal style of cooking. In their nearly 500 years rule over India, they contributed a lot to India including cuisine.
      Since the Mughals were originally from central Asia, the cuisine bears much similarity to the central Asian style of cooking.<br>
      Abundant uses of butter based curries and dried fruits and nuts are striking features of north Indian cuisine. Wheat that grows profusely in northern India forms the larger portion of north Indian meal.
      Contrary to the southern and Northern part of India where rice is the staple food, north India lives on Roti, Chappatis, Paratha and Tandoori all made from wheat.<br>
      Lots of oil, ghee, butter along with rich spices are used as the medium for cooking which lend the north Indian food a very strong flavor.<br>
      Meat also enjoys a special place in north Indian cuisine. A variety of Kebabs and Biriyanis (a tantalizing marinade of rice and meat) bear the Mughal legacy.<br>
      Samosa is possibly the most popular snack in north India. Lassi is another beverage made from curd, which has an overwhelming taste. Gulab Jamun, Motichur Laddoo are popular sweets in this region.<br>
      Some interesting north Indian dishes are Reshmi Kabab, Seekh Kabab, and Shammi Kabab, Kashmiri Pulao, Tandoori Chicken and Mutton to name only a few.
